The widespread emergence of the Internet in the mid 1990s as a platform for electronic data 
distribution and the advent of structured information have revolutionized our ability to deliver 
information to any corner of the world.  While the introduction of Extensible Markup Language 
(XML)as a structured format was a major enabling factor, the promise offered by SOAP based 
webservices triggered the discovery of architectural patterns that are now known as  Service 
Oriented Architecture (SOA).
</br></br>
Service Oriented Architecture is an architectural paradigm and discipline that may be used to 
build infrastructures enabling those with needs (consumers) and those with capabilities 
(providers) to interact via services across disparate domains of technology and ownership.  
Services act as the core facilitator of electronic data interchanges yet require additional mechanisms in order to function. Several new trends in the computer industry rely upon SOA as the 
enabling foundation.  These include the automation of Business Process Management (BPM), 
composite applications (applications that aggregate multiple services to function), and the 
multitude of new architecture and design patterns generally referred to as Web 2.0. 
The latter, Web 2.0, is not defined as a static architecture.  

</br></br>Web 2.0 can be generally characterized 
as a common set of architecture and design patterns, which can be implemented in multiple 
contexts.  The list of common patterns includes the Mashup, Collaboration-Participation, 
Software as a Service (SaaS), Semantic Tagging (folksonomy), and Rich User Experience (also 
known as Rich Internet Application) patterns among others.  These are augmented with themes 
for software architects such as 
trusting your users and harnessing collective intelligence.  Most 
Web 2.0 architecture patterns rely on Service Oriented Architecture in order to function.
When designing Web 2.0 applications based on these patterns, architects often have highly 
specialized requirements for moving data.  Enterprise adoption of these patterns requires special 
considerations for scalability, flexibility (in terms of multiple message exchange patterns), and 
the ability to deliver these services to a multitude of disparate consumers.   Architects often need 
to expand data interchanges beyond simple request-response patterns and adopt more robust 
message exchange patterns, triggered by multiple types of events. As a result, many specialized 
platforms are evolving to meet these needs.
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a paradigm for organizing and utilizing distributed 
capabilities that may be under the control of different ownership domains and implemented 
using various technology stacks. 

</br></br>
In general, entities (people and organizations) create capabilities to solve or support a solution for the problems they face in the course of their business. It is 
natural to think of one persons needs being met by capabilities offered by someone else; or, in 
the world of distributed computing, one computer agents requirements being met by a computer 
agent belonging to a different owner.  

</br></br>The term owner here may be used to denote different 
divisions of one business or perhaps unrelated entities in different countries.
There is not necessarily a one-to-one correlation between needs and capabilities; the granularity 
of needs and capabilities vary from fundamental to complex, and any given need may require a 
combination of numerous capabilities while any single capability may address more than one 
need. One perceived value of SOA is that it provides a powerful framework for matching needs 
and capabilities and for combining capabilities to address those needs by leveraging other 
capabilities.  One capability may be repurposed across a multitude of needs.  
SOA is a “view” of architecture that focuses in on services as the action boundaries between the 
needs and capabilities in a manner conducive to service discovery and repurposing.
